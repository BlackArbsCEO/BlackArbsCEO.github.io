industry:
  - place: Thomson Reuters – Financial and Risk Division
    location: Denver, Colorado
    title: Financial Data Analyst (Contractor)
    dates: January 2014--June 2014
    details:
      - '{\bf Description}: I was contracted as Financial Data Analyst for two main projects within the Financial and Risk division of Thomson Reuters~ PROJECT 1, and PROJECT 2 The primary purpose of PROJECT 1 was to improve data feed quality by clarifying, simplifying and reclassifying data from legacy database systems and data feeds, to integrate with modern higher specification databases which feed Thomson Reuters flagship data products; which are then distributed to clients globally. The purpose of PROJECT 2 was assisting the Senior Financial Data Analyst, post the recent acquisition of the Canadian Globe and Mail media conglomerate, with integration of financial data into Thomson Reuters current flagship data products. In addition to fulfilling the required responsibilities in my role as a financial data analyst I have created long lasting value on the following projects'
      - '{\bf Project 1}: I expanded the role of the financial data analyst as a result of the scope and importance of the project. In addition to the general duties outlined below, I was tasked with acquiring specialized technical knowledge of the proprietary Thomson Reuters’ databases and data feed products in order to fulfill desired project outcomes. The Content team (my group) acted as a bridge between client facing divisions and internal IT/Product development teams; often translating business and client requirements into actionable technical processes that could be interpreted and understood by development, while also proposing and enacting new or improved solutions. I was tasked with attaining proficiency in the following client facing products (LIM, LCORE, ICIS) and ~4 internal databases that support those products to further assist development teams and implement solutions.'  
      - '{\bf Project 2 Performance~Distribution Reconciliation}: Used my Python programming knowledge to develop custom scripts to assist in early high priority assignments. As a result~ I was able to reconcile approximately 20,000 duplicate distributions in days where previous efforts required week(s) and multiple global data analysts to complete. Helped team identify the development logic gaps causing inconsistencies in the performance data. Accuracy of the performance calculations provided by the affected data feeds improved dramatically leading to increased client satisfaction and data consistency.'
      - '{\bf Project 2 add~on}: Improved the data integration and translation process by developing data mapping solution between the two data systems using an idea originally considered impossible. It was thought we could not map certain securities between datasets Globe and Mail and T.R. because we did not share any common identifier codes or data quality was inconsistent. I proposed we use CUSIPS on the individual security level as the link and back that out to identify the issuer names and translations within both systems. As a result~ A framework for efficient data integration and validation checks between Thomson Reuters was created and is currently being used on projects outside of scope. Development was able to successfully map approximately 40,000 issuers in 2 days where previous efforts took days to map approximately 1000 of those 40000. 8000 were high priority issuers needed to fulfill internal and external client requests. This process also lowered the probability of inaccuracies and bad matches filtering through to flagship data feeds via this process to near zero.'
      - '{\bf General Responsibilities}: 1.Financial database management and validation 2.Fulfill requests from client facing divisions for priority data item migration 3.Validate data items and performance calculations in collaboration with IT and internal Global Fund Ownership Groups 4.Assist Content team with process development and internal data migration solutions 5.Analyze large financial data sets (200K lines), identify issues, cleanse data and recommend solutions 6.Data mapping to integrate data sets 7.Facilitate data management and validation solutions between global offshore database management teams and Canadian Fund Ownership teams
        and additional ad hoc requests as needed'
